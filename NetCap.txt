<#Header - Lex Thomas, Keith Ramphal Net Session Capture in Powershell. Modified by Todd Maxey and Muath Deeb#>
# Add - Full frame capture by removing -Truncationlength 512
# Add - Wait till ENTER is pressed to stop trace
# Add - ARP cache and Kerberos ticket purge
# Moved - cache and ticket purge to after starting network trace as not to miss the traffic
# Add Hit "ENTER" to start and stop trace
# Add Elevated permission check
# Removed tracing FOR loop
# Add code to remove any previous NetEventSessions
# Moved Start-NetEventSession -Name NetCap42 to after the user hits ENTER to start the trace. Previously the trace was starting before we flushed the caches
# Adding new line to flush ALL Kerberos tickets on the machine - Get-WmiObject Win32_LogonSession | Where-Object {$_.AuthenticationPackage -ne 'NTLM'} | ForEach-Object {klist.exe purge -li ([Convert]::ToString($_.LogonId, 16))} - Muath Deeb
# Moving the resolver cache and Kerberos flush to just after starting the network trace so we can pick up this traffic
# Added a Netstat -anob output file to corrlate the PID in the trace note to an executable
